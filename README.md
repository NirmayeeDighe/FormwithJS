# FormwithJS
For the JS part:-  Required validations added to the form. For e.g Phone no will not accept string values. If users try wrong input, it will be notified to him a red color text along with each field. This disappears on correcting the field. For mail id – I have restricted the mail to the university’s (northeastern) domain
Used regex to validate phone number, email and zip code.
Created a single select list box which has 5 elements and created list which adds checkbox that changes dynamically for each selection
When checkbox is enabled, a mandatory text field is added which disappears on disabling checkbox.
Upon submitting, an html table is created at the bottom.
This table displays all the details from the form. Upon submitting, all fields are cleared
